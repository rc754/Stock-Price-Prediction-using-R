The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial distress warning system for long-term shareholders. 
Forecasting accuracy is the most important factor in selecting any forecasting methods. Research efforts in improving the accuracy of forecasting models are increasing since the last decade. The appropriate stock selection, those are suitable for investment is a very difficult task.

## AIM 
 In our project we have employed several methods/algorithms for forecasting stock prices, which are ARIMA, GARCH, Prophet, K-Nearest Neighbours regression, Feed Forward Neural Networks and ETS. Further, we have compared the respective accuracies to determine the best model. These methods are applied on Amazon Stock Price data, spanning 5
years, retrieved from Yahoo Finance API. The results will be used to analyze the stock prices and their prediction in depth, in future research efforts.
