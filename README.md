# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-R

The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial distress warning system for long-term shareholders. 
Forecasting accuracy is the most important factor in selecting any forecasting methods. Research efforts in improving the accuracy of forecasting models are increasing since the last decade. The appropriate stock selection, those are suitable for investment is a very difficult task.

## Aim
 In our project we have employed several methods/algorithms for forecasting stock prices, which are ARIMA, GARCH, Prophet, K-Nearest Neighbours regression, Feed Forward Neural Networks and ETS. Further, we have compared the respective accuracies to determine the best model. These methods are applied on Amazon Stock Price data, spanning 5
years, retrieved from Yahoo Finance API. The results will be used to analyze the stock prices and their prediction in depth, in future research efforts.

## Methodologies 
- ARIMA Modeling
- GARCH Modeling
- Prophet Forecasting
- KNN Regression Time Series Forecasting
- Feed Forward Neural Network
- ETS Modeling

In this study we focused in the application of different models, learning how to use them with the objective to forecast new price values. As we can see from our results, the models performed with similar future tendency predictions. All the models predicted a tendency of a higher price in 30 next days. We can conclude that the ARIMA and Neural Net models performed very well inside the prediction intervals and the accuracy metrics. The other models as they are new in this forecasting approach and the objective is to apply them in an intuitive form did not performed as well as ARIMA or Neural Net models.
